When the TiviClick chat system is installed in your website, visitors can request to chat with a website agent.
If you chose to enable this option, visitors can choose to speak with a specific agent from a list of available agents.
If you chose not to show a list of available agents, the visitor’s request will be directed to the first available agent.
The visitor requests to chat, and awaits a response from an available agent.
When visitors send a chat requests, they first submit basic personal information defined by the webmaster. 
If a visitor does not receive a response in a reasonable time – he/she has the option to send a personal email to a specific agent, or a general message that will be sent to any one of the agents.

7. Accepting a Chat Request by an Agent

In order to accept chat requests from visitors, there must be available agents online.
Agents are considered available after they log in to www.tiviclick.com with their username and password.
An account manager that is also an agent must first log in to the management interface, and then enter the “Chats”.
An agent that is not an account manager is transferred directly to this page, and appears online to visitors.
When a visitor sends a request for a chat, the request appears in the agent’s “Waiting Users” table.
An agent can take care of multiple chats simultaneously: One video chat and additional text chats.
It is important to make sure that neither side has pop-up windows disabled on their computer.



8. Starting a Chat with a Visitor

When an available agent receives a chat request from a visitor – a new row is added to the agent’s “Waiting Users” table, and an alert is sounded. The row contains all the information that the visitor was requested to submit.
There will be two buttons available to start the chat:

8.1. Video – The agent can start a video chat with the visitor.
8.2. Text – The agent can start a text chat with the visitor. After starting a text chat, it can be switched to a video chat by clicking the webcam button in the chat box.
Once the agent clicks on one of the buttons, the visitor is notified and can choose to start the chat.
It is recommended to start with a text chat, and switch to video chat at the agent’s discretion.
